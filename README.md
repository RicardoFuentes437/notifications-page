## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge i practiced my knowledges on React, i learned how to change a child component's state inside its parent component, which could definitely be useful for future challenges.

### Continued development

i would like to continue learning about react components and the relationships between them (parent - child).

### Useful resources

- [Communication between parent an child components](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-handle-communication-between-parent-and-child-components-in-reactjs) - This helped me understand more abut the communication between parent an child components in React.
